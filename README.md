# Soccer Player Performance Analysis | Machine Learning

Collaborated on a data-driven analysis of Major League Soccer player performance, focusing on how physical traits (age, height, weight) correlate with offensive output. Leveraged APIs to extract and clean player data, performed K-means clustering to define performance archetypes, and developed predictive regression models to identify performance anomalies. Generated actionable insights for scouting by quantifying the influence of demographic factors and highlighting outlier players exceeding or underperforming expectations.
